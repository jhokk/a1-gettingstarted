## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1 (border and center aligned), h2 (more padding), th, td (table setup specs), and footer (background, center aligned, padding) selectors.
- **Added additional semantic tags**: Included article, table, and footer tags. 

## Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette**: I created a color palette with color.adobe.com and used that for the colors in the stylesheet. An image of the palette is included in this repo. 
- **Used the Signika from Google Fonts**: I used Signika as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
