This project shows the accomplishments I made working on this assignment. First, I needed to refresh myself on how to use HTML and CSS, since I had not worked with either for a few months. I used w3schools.com to learn how to add styling for certain selectors in the stylesheet and how to add more semantic HTML tags. I also learned how to use a font from Google Fonts, which I had never done, but could be very helpful to know in the future. Finally, I created a color palette, which was relatively easy using color.adobe.com, but I spent some time searching for one that I liked. 

## Technical Achievements
- **Styled page with CSS**: Added rules for the h1 (border and center aligned), h2 (more padding), th, td (table setup specs), and footer (background, center aligned, padding) selectors.
- **Added additional semantic tags**: Included article, table, and footer tags. 

## Design Achievements
- **Used a color palette**: I created a color palette with color.adobe.com and used that for the colors in the stylesheet. An image of the palette is included in this repo. 
- **Used the Signika from Google Fonts**: I used Signika as the font for the primary copy text in my site.
