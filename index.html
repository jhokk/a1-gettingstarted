      I'm Jay Hokkanen, a third-year Computer Science student (2025) from midcoast Maine. My pop culture interests include Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, and Avatar: the Last Airbender, and I enjoy D&D, hiking, board-gaming, and playing video games. Some more information about me is that last summer I backpacked the Hadrian's Wall trail in England, I was in Venice for IQP during B-term, my top video games right now are Valheim and Baldur's Gate 3, and my favorite board game is Wingspan.
